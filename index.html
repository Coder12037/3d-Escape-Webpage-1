            What is it and what is it solving?
            <br>
            This project is 3D Escape, where you move around a 3D world trying to survive before the timer runs out.
            <br>
            It is solving nothing, I guess boredom.
            <br>
            How does your idea contribute to society/the community? Who is the target segment for your idea?)
            <br>
            This can help kids in the community to learn this new way of raycasting and have fun and play.
            <br>
            The target age is probably 7+ years old.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            What tools (coding languages, platforms, the cloud, etc.) do you know that you can build your idea using?
            <br>
            We used scratch to make the game, with tons of blocks (I worked 8 hours in a day.)
            <br>
            How much have you completed implementing the idea? How much longer will it take to implement it?
            <br>
            Majority has been completed, we just would add sound effects and “collectables” (which I tried, but they ended up bugging out.)
            <br>
            It would take probably 2 days more to FULLY complete it, with the “collectables.”
            <br>
            What is your motivation in participating in this Hackathon?
            <br>
            The ways I can learn new coding techniques and that there’s a prize. I have the accomplishment of an “amazing game.”

            How to play: In This Game, You Need To use the left and right arrow keys to change where you're looking and your perspective. W,A,S,D is to move around. Normal mode- survive 60 seconds without the ghost killing you and running out of health. Hard mode- survive 50 seconds but it is in low 20 resolution and rounded off. The apples make you get 50+ health. (hard mode no apples) That's how to win!
